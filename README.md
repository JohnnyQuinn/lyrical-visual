# Lyrical Visual

## Objective: 

Listening to a song by itself and listening to it while reading the lyrics are two different things. Spotify as of right now does not have a feature to display real time lyrics of a song being played. Lyrical Visual is meant to facilitate that capability in a cool way. 

## User Persona:

Steven, casual listener
Early 20s 
Casual listener
Mostly knows lyrics of songs just by listening to them

Jason, active listener
Mid 20s 
Active listener
Searches for a complete transcript of a songâ€™s lyrics in order to fully take in the song
