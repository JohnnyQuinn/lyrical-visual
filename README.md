# Lyrical Visual

## Live version
![https://lyrical-visual.herokuapp.com/](https://lyrical-visual.herokuapp.com/)

## Objective: 
Listening to a song by itself and listening to it while reading the lyrics are two different things. Spotify as of right now does not have a feature to display real time lyrics of a song being played. Lyrical Visual is meant to facilitate that capability in a cool way. 


## Inspiration 
Instagram has a feature where users can search a song on spotify and then display the songs along with the song playing. Though this only lasts 15 seconds max.
